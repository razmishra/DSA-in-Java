### 10. Triangle Type Checker
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that checks the type of a triangle given its three side lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program should print:
- "Equilateral" if all three sides are equal.
- "Isosceles" if exactly two sides are equal.
- "Scalene" if all three sides are different.
- "Not a valid triangle" if the given sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).

**Input:**  
```
Three integers a, b, c.
```

**Output:**  
```
The type of triangle or "Not a valid triangle" if the sides do not form a valid triangle.
